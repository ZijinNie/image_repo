2. Each user has its own profile page, which displays all images that he/she uploaded
3. Each image has a detail page which displays the image name, description, uploader and all comments created by other user. User could leave comments under image.
4. Search function allows user to search images by name
5. Home page displays the recently uploaded images by all users
6. User authentification (register/login/logout)

#### Futher improvement:
1. Display images based on their visibility (can be either public/private)
2. Bulk upload
3. Image download
